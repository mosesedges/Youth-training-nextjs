            This is a good example of an attractive 
            minimal portfolio of a creative person, 
            where the “About me” information is perfectly integrated 
            into the design of the website.

            An elegant trendy dark background with geometric patterns, 
            simple and clear navigation – this is what a modern portfolio 
            should look like!

            Since all Web templates are developed on the basis of a deep
            study of the niche and harmoniously combine the most current trends
            in web design, sometimes it’s enough to simply choose a template, 
            add your own unique content and get a 
            beautiful website with the perfect navigation for your type of business!
