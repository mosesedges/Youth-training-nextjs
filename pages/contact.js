            <h1>Contact</h1>
            <p>I work with commercial projects of any scale 
                and with private requests. I use the latest 
                tools and creative approaches that help solve
                a specific business or personal issue.
                <br/>

                I'll be happy to join creative teams to work on 
                young-eyed commercial or social projects. If you 
                think we can create something great together, 
                contact me in any convenient way to discuss the 
                possible cooperation. </p>
